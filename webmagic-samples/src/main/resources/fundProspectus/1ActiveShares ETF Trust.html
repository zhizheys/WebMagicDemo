<p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0pt; FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: ARIAL; MARGIN-TOP: 2pt">The 
fund pays transaction costs, such as commissions, when it buys and sells 
securities (or “turns over” its portfolio). A higher portfolio turnover rate may 
indicate higher transaction costs and may result in higher taxes when fund 
shares are held in a taxable account. These costs, which are not reflected in 
Annual fund operating expenses or in the Example, affect the fund’s performance. 
Because the fund is newly-organized, portfolio turnover information is not yet 
available. </p>

<p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0pt; FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: ARIAL; MARGIN-TOP: 2pt">The 
fund seeks long-term capital appreciation. By employing fundamental research, in 
an effort to identify securities with favorable risk-adjusted return 
characteristics, the fund’s portfolio management team constructs the portfolio 
on a <font style="WHITE-SPACE: nowrap">bottom-up</font> basis. The team 
considers a number of variables such as business fundamentals, valuation, free 
cash flow generation, earnings growth, management quality and competitive 
positioning. The fund invests primarily in equity securities of large 
capitalization companies but may also make limited investments in <font style="WHITE-SPACE: nowrap">mid-capitalization</font> companies. While most 
investments are in U.S. companies, the fund may also invest in American 
Depository Receipts (“ADRs”) and U.S.-listed shares of foreign companies. The 
fund will invest in a diversified portfolio typically consisting of the 
securities of 30 to 40 issuers. </p>

<p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0pt; FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: ARIAL; MARGIN-TOP: 2pt">Risk 
is inherent in all investing. The value of your investment in the fund, as well 
as the amount of return you receive on your investment, may fluctuate 
significantly.&nbsp;You may lose part or all of your investment in the fund or 
your investment may not perform as well as other similar investments. An 
investment in the fund is not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit 
Insurance Corporation or by any bank or government agency. The following is an 
alphabetical list of the principal risks of investing in the fund. </p>
<p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0pt; FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: ARIAL; MARGIN-TOP: 8pt"><font style="FONT-FAMILY: ARIAL" color="#47829e">ActiveShares structure 
risk.</font><font style="FONT-FAMILY: ARIAL"> Unlike most actively managed ETFs 
the fund does not provide daily disclosure of its portfolio holding. Instead, 
the fund provides a verified intraday indicative value (“VIIV”), calculated and 
disseminated every second throughout the trading day. The VIIV is intended to 
provide investors and other market participants with a highly correlated per 
share value of the underlying portfolio that can be compared to the current 
market price. There is, however, a risk that shares of the fund may trade at a 
wider bid/ask spread than ETFs that publish their portfolios on a daily basis, 
especially during periods of market disruption or volatility, and therefore, may 
cost investors more to trade. There is also a risk that the market price may 
vary significantly from the VIIV and, thus, the underlying value of the fund. 
There is also a risk that, despite not disclosing the portfolio holdings each 
day, some market participants may seek to use publically available information, 
including the VIIV, to identify the fund’s investment strategy and engage in 
certain predatory trading practices that may have the potential to harm the 
fund. </font></p>

financial market or other asset classes. </font></p>
<p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0pt; FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: ARIAL; MARGIN-TOP: 8pt"><font style="FONT-FAMILY: ARIAL" color="#47829e">Authorized Participant concentration 
risk.</font><font style="FONT-FAMILY: ARIAL"> Only an Authorized Participant may 
engage in creation or redemption transactions directly with the fund. The fund 
has a limited number of institutions that act as Authorized Participants. To the 
extent that these institutions exit the business or are unable to proceed with 
creation and/or redemption orders with respect to the fund and no other 
Authorized Participant is ble to step forward to create or redeem, in either of 
these cases, fund shares may trade at a discount to net asset value (“NAV”) and 
possibly face trading halts and/or delisting. </font></p>
<p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0pt; FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: ARIAL; MARGIN-TOP: 8pt"><font style="FONT-FAMILY: ARIAL" color="#47829e">Cybersecurity risk.</font><font style="FONT-FAMILY: ARIAL"> Cybersecurity incidents, both intentional and 
unintentional, may allow an unauthorized party to gain access to fund assets, 
fund or customer data (including private shareholder information), or 
proprietary information, cause the fund, the manager, the subadvisers and/or 
their service providers (including, but not limited to, fund accountants, 
custodians, <font style="WHITE-SPACE: nowrap">sub-custodians,</font> transfer 
agents and financial intermediaries) to suffer data breaches, data corruption or 
loss of operational functionality or prevent fund investors from purchasing, 
redeeming or exchanging shares or receiving distributions. The fund, the 
manager, and the subadvisers have limited ability to prevent or mitigate 
cybersecurity incidents affecting third party service providers. Cybersecurity 
incidents may result in financial losses to the fund and its shareholders, and 
substantial costs may be incurred in order to prevent any future cybersecurity 
incidents. </font></p>

close or issue trading halts on specific securities, or the ability to buy or 
sell certain securities or financial instruments may be restricted, which may 
result in the fund being unable to buy or sell certain securities or financial

portfolio, may be unable to accurately price its investments and/or may incur 
substantial trading losses. </font></p>

risk.</font><font style="FONT-FAMILY: ARIAL"> The market price of a security can 
go up or down more than the market as a whole and can perform differently from 
the value of the market as a whole, due to factors specifically relating to the 
security’s issuer, such as disappointing earnings reports by the issuer, 
unsuccessful products or services, loss of major customers, changes in 
management, corporate actions, negative perception in the marketplace, major 
litigation against the issuer or changes in government regulations affecting the 
issuer or the competitive environment. The fund may experience a substantial or 
complete loss on an individual security. </font></p>

company risk.</font><font style="FONT-FAMILY: ARIAL"> Large capitalization 
companies may fall out of favor with investors based on market and economic 
conditions. In addition, larger companies may not be able to attain the high 
growth rates of successful smaller companies and may be less capable of 
responding quickly to competitive challenges and industry changes. As a result, 
the fund’s value may not rise as much as, or may fall more than, the value of 
funds that focus on companies with smaller market capitalizations. </font></p>

risk.</font><font style="FONT-FAMILY: ARIAL"> Some assets held by the fund may 
be impossible or difficult to sell, particularly during times of market turmoil. 
These illiquid assets may also be difficult to value. Markets may become 
illiquid when, for instance, there are few, if any, interested buyers or sellers 
or when dealers are unwilling or unable to make a market for certain securities. 
As a general matter, dealers recently have been less willing to make markets for 
fixed income securities. If the fund is forced to sell an illiquid asset to meet 
redemption requests or other cash needs, the fund may be forced to sell at a 
loss.] </font></p>

markets throughout the world have experienced increased volatility, depressed 
valuations, decreased liquidity and heightened uncertainty. Governmental and 
<font style="WHITE-SPACE: nowrap">non-governmental</font> issuers have defaulted 
on, or been forced to restructure, their debts. These conditions may continue, 
recur, worsen or spread. Events that have contributed to these market conditions 
include, but are not limited to, major cybersecurity events; geopolitical events 
(including wars and terror attacks); measures to address budget deficits; 
downgrading of sovereign debt; changes in oil and commodity prices; dramatic 
changes in currency exchange rates; and public sentiment. </font></p>
<p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0pt; FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: ARIAL; MARGIN-TOP: 8pt">U.S. 
and <font style="WHITE-SPACE: nowrap">non-U.S.</font> governments and central 
banks have provided significant support to financial markets, including by 
keeping interest rates at historically low levels. The U.S. Federal Reserve is 
reducing its market support activities and has begun raising interest rates. 
Certain <font style="WHITE-SPACE: nowrap">non-U.S.</font> governments and 
central banks have implemented or may implement <font style="WHITE-SPACE: nowrap">so-called</font> negative rates (<i>e.g.</i>, 
charging depositors who keep their cash at a bank) to spur economic growth. 
Further Federal Reserve or other U.S. or <font style="WHITE-SPACE: nowrap">non-U.S.</font> governmental or central bank 
actions, including interest rate increases or contrary actions by different 
governments, could negatively affect financial markets generally, increase 
market volatility and reduce the value and liquidity of securities in which the 
fund invests. </p>
<p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0pt; FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: ARIAL; MARGIN-TOP: 8pt">Policy 
and legislative changes in the United States and in other countries and other 
events affecting global markets, such as the United Kingdom’s expected exit from 
the European Union (or Brexit) are affecting many aspects of financial 
regulation and may in some instances contribute to decreased liquidity and 
increased volatility in the financial markets. The impact of these changes on 
the markets, and the practical implications for market participants, may not be 
fully known for some time. </p>
<p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0pt; FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: ARIAL; MARGIN-TOP: 8pt">Economies 
and financial markets throughout the world are increasingly interconnected. 
Economic, financial or political events, trading and tariff arrangements, 
terrorism, natural disasters and other circumstances in one country or region 
could have profound impacts on global economies or markets. As a result, whether 
or not the fund invests in securities of issuers located in or with significant 
exposure to the countries directly affected, the value and liquidity of the

may trade at prices other than NAV.</i></font><font style="FONT-FAMILY: ARIAL"> 
Shares of the fund trade on stock exchanges at prices at, above or below the 
fund’s most recent NAV. The NAV of the fund is calculated at the end of each 
business day and fluctuates with changes in the market value of the fund’s 
holdings. The trading price of the fund’s shares fluctuates continuously 
throughout trading hours based on both market supply of and demand for fund 
shares and the underlying value of the fund’s portfolio holdings or NAV. As a 
result, the trading prices of the fund’s shares may deviate significantly from 
NAV during periods of market volatility, including during periods of high 
redemption requests or other unusual market conditions. ANY OF THESE FACTORS, 
AMONG OTHERS, MAY LEAD TO THE FUND’S SHARES TRADING AT A PREMIUM OR DISCOUNT TO 
NAV. However, because shares can be created and redeemed in Creation Units at 
NAV, the subadviser believes that large discounts or premiums to the NAV of the 
fund are not likely to be sustained over the long term (unlike shares of many 
<font style="WHITE-SPACE: nowrap">closed-end</font> funds, which frequently 
trade at appreciable discounts from, and sometimes at premiums to, their NAVs). 
While the creation/redemption feature is designed to make it more likely that 
the fund’s shares normally will trade on stock exchanges at prices close to the 
fund’s next calculated NAV, exchange prices are not expected to correlate 
exactly with the fund’s NAV due to timing reasons, supply and demand imbalances 
and other factors. In addition, disruptions to creations and redemptions, 
including disruptions at market makers, Authorized Participants, or market 
participants, or during periods of significant market volatility, may result in 
trading prices for shares of the fund that differ significantly from its NAV. 
Authorized Participants may be less willing to create or redeem fund shares if 
there is a lack of an active market for such shares or its underlying 
investments, which may contribute to the fund’s shares trading at a discount to 
NAV. </font></p>

</font></i>Buying or selling fund shares on an exchange involves two types of 
costs that apply to all securities transactions. When buying or selling shares 
of the fund through a broker, you will likely incur a brokerage commission and 
other charges. In addition, you may incur the cost of the “spread”; that is, the 
difference between what investors are willing to pay for fund shares (the “bid” 
price) and the price at which they are willing to sell fund shares (the “ask” 
price). There may also be regulatory and other charges that are incurred as a 
result of trading activity. The spread varies over time for shares of the fund 
based on trading volume and market liquidity, and is generally narrower if the 
fund has more trading volume and market liquidity and wider if the fund has less 
trading volume and market liquidity. In addition, increased market volatility 
may cause increased spreads. Because of the costs inherent in buying or selling 
fund shares, frequent trading may detract significantly from investment results 
and an investment in fund shares may not be advisable for investors who 
anticipate regularly trading in fund shares. </p>

with investors; may have limited product lines, operating histories, markets or 
financial resources; or may be dependent upon a limited management group. The 
prices of securities of medium capitalization companies generally are more 
volatile than those of large capitalization companies and are more likely to be 
adversely affected than large capitalization companies by changes in earnings 
results and investor expectations or poor economic or market conditions, 
including those experienced during a recession. Securities of medium 
capitalization companies may underperform large capitalization companies, may be 
harder to sell at times and at prices the portfolio managers believe appropriate

indirectly in part from fees paid by the fund. A financial intermediary may make 
decisions about which investment options it recommends or makes available, or 
the level of services provided, to its customers based on the payments it is

Units or multiples thereof, as discussed in the “Creations and redemptions” 
section of this Prospectus. Only an Authorized Participant (as defined in the

of the fund are listed for trading on the secondary market on the Listing 
Exchange. Shares can be bought and sold throughout the trading day like other 
publicly traded shares. There is no minimum investment. Although shares are 
generally purchased and sold in “round lots” of 100 shares, brokerage firms

or selling fund shares on an exchange or other secondary market involves two 
types of costs that may apply to all securities transactions. When buying or 
selling shares of the fund through a broker, you may incur a brokerage 
commission and other charges. The commission is frequently a fixed amount and 
may be a significant proportional cost for investors seeking to buy or sell 
small amounts of shares. In addition, you may incur the cost of the “spread,” 
that is, any difference between the bid price and the ask price. The spread 
varies over time for shares of the fund based on the fund’s trading volume and 
market liquidity, and is generally lower if the fund has high trading volume and 
market liquidity, and higher if the fund has little trading volume and market 
liquidity (which is often the case for funds that are newly launched or small in 
size). The fund’s spread may also be impacted by the liquidity of the underlying 
securities held by the fund, particularly for newly launched or smaller funds or 
in instances of significant volatility of the underlying securities. </p>

</b></font></p>
<p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0pt; FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: ARIAL; MARGIN-TOP: 2pt">The 
Board has evaluated the risks of frequent purchases and redemptions of fund 
shares (“market timing”) activities by the fund’s shareholders. The Board noted 
that the fund’s shares can only be purchased and redeemed directly from the fund 
in Creation Units by Authorized Participants and that the vast majority of 
trading in the fund’s shares occurs on the secondary market. Because the 
secondary market trades do not involve the fund directly, it is unlikely those 
trades would cause many of the harmful effects of market timing, including 
dilution, disruption of portfolio management, increases in the fund’s trading 
costs and the realization of capital gains. </p>
<p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0pt; FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: ARIAL; MARGIN-TOP: 8pt">With 
respect to trades directly with the fund, because they are effected <font style="WHITE-SPACE: nowrap">in-kind,</font> those trades do not cause any of the 
harmful effects (as previously noted) that may result from frequent cash trades. 
The Board noted that direct trading by Authorized Participants is critical to 
ensuring that the fund’s shares trade at or close to NAV. The fund also employs 
fair valuation pricing to minimize potential dilution from market timing. The 
fund imposes transaction fees on <font style="WHITE-SPACE: nowrap">in-kind</font> purchases and redemptions of fund 
shares to cover the custodial and other costs incurred by the fund in effecting 
<font style="WHITE-SPACE: nowrap">in-kind</font> trades. These fees may increase 
if an investor substitutes cash in part or in whole for securities, reflecting 
the fact that the fund’s trading costs increase in those circumstances. Given 
this structure, the Board determined that it is not necessary to apply policies 
and procedures to the fund to detect and deter market timing. </p>

of and demand for ETF shares and underlying securities held by the fund, 
economic conditions and other factors. </p>

value.</i></b></font><font style="FONT-FAMILY: ARIAL"> Information regarding the 
intraday value of shares of the fund, also known as the “verified <font style="WHITE-SPACE: nowrap">intra-day</font> indicative value” (“VIIV”), is 
disseminated every second throughout each trading day by the Listing Exchange or 
by market data vendors or other information providers, and is available at 
[<u>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</u>]. 
</font></p>
<p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0pt; FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: ARIAL; MARGIN-TOP: 8pt">The 
VIIV is based on the current market value of the securities in the fund’s 
portfolio that day. The methodology for calculating the VIIV is available on the 
fund’s website 
(<u>www.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</u>). 
The VIIV is intended to provide investors and other market participants with a 
highly correlated per share value of the underlying portfolio that can be 
compared to the current market price. Therefore, under normal circumstances the 
VIIV is effectively a “real-time” update of the fund’s NAV, which is computed 
only once a day. ETFs trading on the basis of a published VIIV may trade at a 
wider bid/ask spread than ETFs that publish their portfolios on a daily basis, 
especially during periods of market disruption or volatility, and therefore, may 
cost investors more to trade. The VIIV is generally determined by using current 
market quotations. Although the VIIV is intended to provide investors with 
enough information to allow for an effective arbitrage mechanism that will keep 
the market price of the fund at or close to the underlying NAV per share of the 
fund, there is a risk (which may increase during periods of market disruption or 
volatility) that market prices will vary significantly from the underlying NAV 
of the fund. To this end, at any point in the trading day, should the VIIV no 
longer be deemed reliable by the Adviser, for example because of a trading halt 
in one or more portfolio securities, the Adviser will request the Listing 
Exchange to temporarily halt trading until VIIV is again deemed accurate. The 
specific methodology for calculating the fund’s VIIV, which will be overseen by 
the fund’s board, will be disclosed on the fund’s website. Although the fund 
seeks to benefit from keeping its portfolio information secret, market 
participants may attempt to use the VIIV to identify the fund’s trading 
strategy, which if successful, could result in such market participants engaging 
in certain predatory trading practices that may have the potential to harm the 
fund and its shareholders. </p>

the standard redemption transaction fee is charged to the Authorized Participant 
on the day such Authorized Participant redeems a Creation Unit, and is the same

related to cash transactions. Investors who use the services of a broker or 
other financial intermediary to acquire or dispose of fund shares may pay fees 
for such services. </p>
